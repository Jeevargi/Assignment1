1)Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
 *	Its high level language because its can be read easily uses simple english language and general purpose language as it is used solve problems
 
2)Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
 *	Variables donâ€™t associate with any particular types
 
3)List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
 *	Pros: - Easy to learn
			large community built in functions
			High level language
			Big data machine learning
	cons: - limitation in speed
			Security
			memory insuffcient 
			
4)In what all domains can we use Python?
 * 	AI & Machine Learning
	Big data data science analyst 
	
5)What are variable and how can we declare them?
* Variablesa are the name given to a specfic object to call them we can declare them just by using it and assgining values to it python will automatically determines data types

6)How can we take an input from the user in Python?
* Input form user can be done by using Input function 
	Syntax :- a = input()
	values provided by user will be stored in variable "a"

7)What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
*  string 

8)What is type casting?
* Type casting is nothing but changing dtat types of variable we can do it by just giving datatype which you want to change
	ex:-  a = 98 this is int
	to convert into string we do a=str(a) it will be converted
	
9)Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
* Yes we can by using spilt function

10)What are keywords?
* Keywords are reserved words used for a specfic task to do.

11)Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
* No we cant use keywords as variable they are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language

12)What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
* Indentation in python is used to tell that the group of statements belongs to a particular block of code. A block is a combination of all these statements

13)How can we throw some output in Python?
* By usimg print() function

14)What are operators in Python?
* +,-,/,%,*,//

15)What is difference between / and // operators?
* / gives floor division, // gives interger division.

16) Write a code that gives following as an output.
* print("iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron")

17)Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.

number = int(input())
if number%2 == 0:
    print("Even")
else:
    print("odd")
	
18)What are boolean operator?
* the operators that operate on the Boolean values

19) What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0 --> 1

0 and 0 --> 0

True and False and True -->False

1 or 0 or 0 -->1
```
20) What are conditional statements in Python?
* conditional statements are statements which executed when condition is satisfied 

21)What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
* if,elif,else are used to check conditions and provide output bassed on condition

22)Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".

age = int(input())
if age >= 18:
    print("I can vote")
else:
    print("I can't vote")
	
23)Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
sum1=0
for i in range(0,len(numbers)):
    sum1 += numbers[i]
print(sum1)

24)Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=int(input())
if a>b and a>c:
    print(a)
elif b>a and b>c:
    print(b)
else:
    print(c)
	
25)Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
sum1=0
for i in range(0,len(numbers)):
    if numbers[i] > 500:
        break
    elif numbers[i] % 5 == 0:
        if numbers[i] > 150:
            continue
        sum1 += numbers[i]
print(sum1)
